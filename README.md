# clean-desktop
Simple bash script to automate a clean desktop just for the fun of it.

This script simply keeps the desktop free of clutter by moving files to appropriate directories, based on file extension. Essentially, anytime the user pastes, copies or moves a file on to the desktop, the script should automoatically move it to the appropriate directory.

Currently, it only deals with mp3, wav, jpg, jpeg, png, gif, mp4, mov, flv, and avi files. However, file extension and related move paths can be manually added simply by editing the script itself.
